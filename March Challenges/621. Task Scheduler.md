```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks, n) -> int:
        task_counts = Counter(tasks)
        max_count = max(task_counts.values())
        num_max_tasks = sum(1 for count in task_counts.values() if count == max_count)
        
        # Calculate the total number of intervals required
        intervals = (max_count - 1) * (n + 1) + num_max_tasks
        
        # If the calculated intervals are less than the length of tasks,
        # return the length of tasks (no need for idle intervals)
        return max(intervals, len(tasks))
```
